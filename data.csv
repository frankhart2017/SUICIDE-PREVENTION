It doesn't help. Trust me
I can't get better I already made my decision.
"I hate myself I'll always hate myself, I'm never gonna view myself as good I'm so far behind"
Make the pain go away like you said
I'm just to sensitive.  I want my family to know there was nothing they could do. I am entrapped in my own thoughts
i'm overthinking everything. . fuck. I gotta stop and just do it
Idk I'm freaking out again
I dont feel life is worth anything.
Hmmm. Well i feel hopeless with life
"Time seems to be passing away, and i feel it is being wasted"
If I was dead people wouldn’t have to worry about me.
No one would care if I was gone
I don’t want to be here anymore.
I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up.
I want to kill myself
No one would miss me if I wasn’t around anymore.
I am completely over it.
"To my friends, my work is done — Why wait?"
I am going to put myself to sleep now for a bit longer than usual. Call it Eternity.
"All fled-all done, so lift me on the pyre; The feast is over, and the lambs expire."
I must end it. There's no hope left. I'll be at peace. No one had anything to do with this. My decision totally.
"Oh my love Kate, you did all you could. I'm unemployable & a nuisance. Forget me, remarry, be happy."
"I am afraid, I am a coward. I am sorry for everything. If I had done this a long time ago, it would have saved a lot of pain. P.E"
Life has become unbearable for me…Forgive me.
"Dear World, I am leaving because I am bored. I feel I have lived long enough. I am leaving you with your worries in this sweet cesspool. Good luck."
 I feel we can't go through another of those terrible times.
And I shan't recover this time
I can't fight any longer.
If anybody could have saved me it would have been you
"It would be natural to be upset but do not be for me, I am better now, in a better place."
I am sorry I care but I need to escape and I cannot wait to see what is on the other side.
I myself and my wife – in order to escape the disgrace of deposition or capitulation – choose death.
"I am not able to bear any longer the weight of my misfortunes, which I have brought upon myself. "
I wish to use my body as a torch to dissipate the darkness and to waken love among men
"I will kill myself tomorrow unable to stand existence without the women who had been my sole joy, the only hapinnes in my life"
I can't handle the situation anymore. I can’t explain this to anybody as nobody believes my innocence not even my family
I just wasn't meant for this world. I want a new beginning where I can find peace and hapinness
I have a feeling that I shall go mad as I hear voices and cannot concentrate on my work. I can't fight against it any longer
I am tired of hurting and feeling lonely my head hurts from crying but if I take anything I am scared that I won't stop and I would want to stop
"To make everything better I have to die, I can't make it right by living."
I can't stand the empty feeling that I am having. I am breaking into pieces.
What is a few short years to live in hell? This is no way to live it is anyday better to die.
When all usefulness is over it is best to choose a quick and easy death in place of a slow and horrible one
I am making my final exit in a few minutes. I want to encourage those who want to but are letting fear hold them back. I expect pain to outweigh happiness and satisfaction in my life
I feel as though no one cares for me in this world. It is not worth living.
